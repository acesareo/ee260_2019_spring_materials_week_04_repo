Lab4_1_1

We attempted this lab but didn’t really get a chance to finish it because we ran out of time. One of the few challenges that we face was trying to figure out how to use the test bench. Long story short we were able to figure it out and will be able to use the testbench on our own in the future. The second challenge that we faced was that we didn’t really get the code corrected. We the thought the code was much simpler but we forgot the most important part in binary addition which was the carry over. We learn that we need to be prepared in what we are doing so that we don't run into this problem again.


Lab4_2_1
This lab was basically the same thing as part one of lab 4 the only differences is that instead of adding 2 4 bits together you are now adding a 4 bit and a 5 bit together. Since we didn’t solve the problem for part one about carry over we couldn’t really finish this problem either since they were the same.

Lab4_2_2
Part 3 of lab 4 was kind of similar to the rest of lab 4 but we are using an 8 bit input this. We ran out of time and didn’t get a chance to attempt this problem but our guess would be that we would run into the same carrying over problem as before. After this lab we learn that figuring out one problem could be beneficial in the long run and since we didn’t we couldn’t really finish this lab.
